# NornsShieldCase
I wanted to make a 3d printable case for the Monome Norns shield without top panel screws. 

Note: this is my first Fusion 360 design, and remains untested as I currently don't have a 3d printer to make one.

The case consists of two parts. Construction as follows:
1. Turn the top part of the case over, front facing you.
2. Use a soldering iron to melt in the two M2.5 threaded inserts into the two front holes.
3. Put the Norns Shield PCB in the top part and screw in the two M2.5 hex standoffs in the two back holes.
4. Put in the RPi, connecting it to the Norns Shield PCB using the header* 
5. Turn over and put on the bottom part of the case and screw in the M2.5 screws to finish.

(* not sure if this will work with the ports extruding from the case, but there's a little wiggle room in the header of the RPi)
